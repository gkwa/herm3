### Employ Go 1.18+ generics
Create generic constructor functions that ensure proper initialization across different struct types with interface fields.

This solution addresses the nil interface problem by:

1. Type Safety: Ensures type-safe initialization of structs with interface fields.
2. Code Reuse: Allows for reusable initialization logic across different types.
3. Flexibility: Provides a flexible way to initialize different struct types with similar patterns.
4. Compile-Time Checks: Leverages compiler to catch type-related errors early.
5. Abstraction: Allows for abstract, reusable code without sacrificing type safety.
