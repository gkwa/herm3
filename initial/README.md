### Summary

We're exploring a common design issue in Go programming where struct initialization with interface fields can lead to unexpected runtime panics.

Our scenario involves two types: Company (which is our struct) and Department (which is now an interface).

The Company struct has a method that depends on an initialized Department interface.

However, if we're not careful with our initialization, we may encounter a panic when calling this method due to a nil interface value.

This exercise will help us understand the importance of proper struct initialization with interface fields and how to avoid such runtime errors in real-world scenarios like company management systems.

Now, let's create a new code example that demonstrates this problem:

```go
package main

import (
   "fmt"
)

type Department interface {
   GetName() string
}

type Company struct {
   PrimaryDepartment Department
}

func (c *Company) DisplayInfo() {
   fmt.Printf("Company's primary department: %s\n", c.PrimaryDepartment.GetName())
}

func main() {
   // Create a Company without initializing its PrimaryDepartment
   myCompany := &Company{}

   // This will panic because myCompany.PrimaryDepartment is nil
   myCompany.DisplayInfo()
}
