### Use linters and static analysis tools
Catch potential nil interface dereferences before runtime.

This solution addresses the nil interface problem by:

1. Early Detection: Identifies potential nil interface issues during development.
2. Automated Checking: Integrates into CI/CD pipelines for consistent code quality.
3. Best Practices: Enforces coding standards and best practices.
4. Comprehensive Analysis: Examines the entire codebase for potential issues.
5. Continuous Improvement: Helps developers learn and improve their code quality over time.
